//Reference docs

// Hi,
// My impression is that you will end sending WEI every time, 
// but depending on the application that will display the value sent it will show it in BNB or WEI depending on the value that you sent. 
// In this particular case when 500 WEI are sent, it they were to display it in BNB it would have been 0.000000000000000500 BNB, 
// that maybe would not look so great as 500 WEI.

// 1 BNB = 1000000000000000000 WEI and the application can display the value in what is better to display from case to case.
